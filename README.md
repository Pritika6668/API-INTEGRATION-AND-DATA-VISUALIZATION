## Project Description

The "API Integration and Data Visualization" project is a comprehensive internship task aimed at building foundational skills in Python programming, RESTful API handling, and data visualization. As part of the Python Development domain, this project enhances the practical understanding of how modern applications consume real-time data from third-party APIs and present it in meaningful visual formats.

In this project, we used 'Python' as the primary programming language due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries for both API handling and data visualization. The project focuses on integrating a weather forecasting API (such as the OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch real-time weather data, process it, and visualize important metrics using plotting libraries.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+ – Core programming language
- Requests – For sending HTTP requests to external APIs
- JSON– For parsing and handling API responses
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly – For visualizing weather data
- VS Code – Development environment
 - Git & GitHub – For version control and publishing the project

## Platforms Used

- GitHub: Used to host the project repository and track version history.
- OpenWeatherMap API (or similar): Used to obtain weather data like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
- VS Code: Primary code editor used for development and debugging.

## Functionalities Implemented

- Integrated with a live weather API to fetch current and forecast weather data for a user-specified location.
- Parsed and processed JSON data to extract meaningful information like temperature trends, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
- Visualized extracted data using bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts for better insight into the weather patterns.
- Provided user interaction via command-line inputs to enter the desired city or country for which the weather data is required.

## Applications of This Project

- Weather Dashboards: Can be used to power weather dashboards for websites or mobile apps.
- Travel Planning Apps: Useful for integrating weather forecasts into apps for travelers and logistics planners.
- Smart Home Systems: Can be used in smart thermostats or home automation systems that adjust settings based on weather conditions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Learned how to interact with RESTful APIs using Python.
- Improved skills in parsing and manipulating JSON data.
- Gained practical experience in visualizing complex data in user-friendly formats.
- Developed the ability to write clean, modular, and well-commented Python code.
- Understood the importance of data representation in driving decision-making.

## Final Thoughts

This project is an excellent example of how programming, data science, and visualization come together to solve real-world problems. It not only demonstrates API integration and chart plotting skills but also emphasizes the importance of clean user interface and data presentation. The knowledge gained from this internship will serve as a strong foundation for future roles in full-stack development, data analytics, and cloud-based application development.
